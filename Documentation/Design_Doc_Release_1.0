+++Section 1 - Aim Of The Document+++

Declare the project goals for release 1.0 and describe the implementation
details.

+++Section 2 - Project Statement+++

A. Provide a simple API to the user space C programs for queueing multiple 
tasks in queues, one each for a configurable number of threads.

B. Take away the complexity of defining/maintaining structures required to 
queue tasks and to synchronize among the threads operating on these queues.
Thereby allowing programmer to focus on business logic while using a fairly
advanced infrastructure to parallelize/synchronize work.

C. Provide a single API call for each of the following jobs.

    1. define taskqueues with a configurable number of threads.

    2. queue tasks to a queue structure, one belonging to each thread.

    3. synchronization call to wait for all the currently queued tasks to finish

    4. destroy the whole taskqueue structure gracefully.

+++Section 3 - Implementation Details+++

++Section 3.1 - Design Philosophy++

Application programs should be able to make full use of the computing power
at their disposal while executing tasks that can be parallelized. Specially the
compute intensive tasks that can make use of the multi core environments widely
available. While PThreads provide us with a fundamental API for creating and
managing multi threaded applications, they do involve fair bit of low level 
details that a programmer needs to concern herself with. These are details like
creation of threads, synchronization among them and such.

The programmer has to be an expert on Pthreads and the concepts of parallel
computing to write a decent sized code. While it is intrinsic to being a 
good software developer, it is NOT the real challenge that she is trying to
solve here. It is more to be seen as an enabling infrastructure to solve a
problem. Hence, I want to take it out as a separate library that can be linked
to by the application thereby making the code more manageable and faster to 
write and test.

++Section 3.2 - Technical Overview+++

Rather than creating/managing individual threads dealing with individual tasks,
the programmer deals with something called a taskqueue. This is similar in
functionality to workqueues from the Linux Kernel space.

A taskqueue has a configurable number of sub structures, appropriately named as
sub_taskqueues. Also, it contains a list of special flush structures defined 
and used by a calling thread to sleep while all the currently queued tasks
finish executing.

Each sub_taskqueue primarily contains the following elements.
...queue structure where user defined tasks(functions) can be queued
...PThread based thread to operate on these tasks
...PThread based condition variable for the thread to sleep and be woken when 
there is a task in the queue

Each flush structure primarily contains the following elements.
...PThread based condition variable where the calling thread sleeps while 
waiting for all the queued tasks to finish execution.
...a queue containing IDs of the last task at each sub_taskqueue at the time 
when flush API call was made. All these tasks have to finish before the
calling thread is woken up.
...a counter for the number of tasks on which calling thread will wait.

Each task structure primarily contains the following elements.
...pointer to the function that defines the task
...pointer to the structure that contains data to be operated upon
...an ID that is unique among all the tasks in the queue
